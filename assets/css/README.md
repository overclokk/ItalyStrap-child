* This starter child theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
* Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
* This child theme works only with the ItalyStrap Theme Framework.

* Use the custom.scss or custom.css file to put your CSS.

* The framework loads js and css files automatically.

* You can create a specific js/css file for any theme template, for example if you want a CSS or JS only for the front-page.php than you have to create front-page.css and/or front-page.js and thoose files will be loaded instead of custom.css only in front-page.php, if no file are founded than custom.css/index.js will be loaded.
